# 3D-vs-Real-Object-Measurement

This project compares real object dimensions (measured with OpenCV) to 3D model dimensions (from STL files using Open3D).

## Features
- Measure thickness, width, and height using top/side images
- Compare with STL dimensions
- GUI with PyQt5
- STL viewer using Open3D

## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- OpenCV
- Open3D
- PyQt5

## Run
```bash
python main.py
